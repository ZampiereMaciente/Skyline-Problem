# Skyline Problem - Induction Paradigm

### Induction Paradigm.

>#### The induction paradigm is a form of logical-mathematical reasoning used to prove a property or establish a universal truth based on specific cases. It is widely applied in various fields of mathematics, computer science and logic.

### Skyline Problem
>#### The problem in question consists of developing a program to help an architect in the design of a city skyline, given the location of the city's buildings. To make the problem tractable, all buildings have rectangular shapes and they share a common base (the city they are built in is very flat). The city is also seen as two-dimensional. A building is specified by an ordinate triple (Ei, Ai, Di), where Ei and Di are the left and right coordinates, respectively, of building i, and Ai is the height of the building. 
>#### In the example below the buildings are shown with triples 
>#### [(1,11,5),(2,6,7),(3,13,9),(12,7,16),(14,3,25),(19,18,22),( 23,13,29),(24,4,28)] the horizon line as a final solution is represented by the sequence: [(1.11), (3.13), (9.0), (12.7), (16.3), (19.18), (22.3), (23.13), ( 29.0)]
